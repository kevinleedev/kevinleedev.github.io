<p>Like css3,javascript as well as nodejs which is so powerful,that a great thing I think.As I said,I did what I committed today - the policecar which is very simple but good.I will keep on reasearching on frontend.</p>

<p>GCS is used to create lesson for gc.com registered users,like guitar lesson,base lesson etc.However,it's not over,it's not a huge project but lots of technologys in it.We build the dev environment with spring mvc,spring3 and hibernate4 as backend env,I thought spring mvc a fatanstic framework which is simple but useful and transaction of hibernate is never a weakness in this version and the annotation of spring always my favorite which makes code beautiful.Also,the focus is what we used of frontend in this project,requirejs,backbone,jquery are used to make gcs works perfectly.the javascript OOD is well understood in this practice.Since backbone makes post or get request simple thanks to it's 'model' and I like the way it binds event to html element.</p>
